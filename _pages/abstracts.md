### Title
Dimer models: consistency, Calabi–Yau properties and categorification
### Abstract
A dimer model is a bipartite graph drawn in a surface. First introduced in the context of statistical mechanics, dimer models became a significant topic in string theory around fifteen years ago. In mathematics, a key development at this time was the study of consistency conditions, and the use of dimer models on the torus to construct non-commutative crepant resolutions of 3-dimensional Gorenstein singularities. A key property of a consistent dimer model is that its associated non-commutative dimer algebra is 3-Calabi–Yau. More recently, dimer models have reappeared, now on surfaces with boundary and sometimes called plabic graphs or Postnikov diagrams, in the context of categorifying cluster algebras with coefficients, notably the cluster structure on the Grassmannian and its positroid strata. In this lecture series, I will survey these ideas.
