**Generalized preprojective algebras**

Classical preprojective algebras were introduced by Gelfand-Ponomarev and further studied by Dlab-Ringel and many others. Their connection with Lie theory was discovered by Lusztig, who realized the enveloping algebra of the positive part of a symmetric Kac-Moody Lie algebra as a convolution algebra of constructible functions on module varieties of a preprojective algebra.
In joint work with Geiss and Schröer, we used Lusztig's construction to obtain categorifications of the cluster algebra structure on coordinate rings of certain finite-dimensional unipotent subgroups of symmetric Kac-Moody groups labelled by Weyl group elements. These results require the generalized Cartan matrix to be symmetric. So the question arises of a possible generalization to the symmetrizable case. This motivated a series of joint works with Geiss and Schröer on a new class of 1-Iwanaga-Gorenstein algebras associated with symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrices, and their generalized preprojective algebras.
In these talks I will give a survey of this construction and its application to crystal bases, and I will explain how it relates to joint work with Hernandez on representations of quantum affine algebras. Finally if time allows, I will discuss some recent developments by Murakami and Fujita-Murakami.

**Dimer models: consistency, Calabi–Yau properties and categorification**

A dimer model is a bipartite graph drawn in a surface. First introduced in the context of statistical mechanics, dimer models became a significant topic in string theory around fifteen years ago. In mathematics, a key development at this time was the study of consistency conditions, and the use of dimer models on the torus to construct non-commutative crepant resolutions of 3-dimensional Gorenstein singularities. A key property of a consistent dimer model is that its associated non-commutative dimer algebra is 3-Calabi–Yau. More recently, dimer models have reappeared, now on surfaces with boundary and sometimes called plabic graphs or Postnikov diagrams, in the context of categorifying cluster algebras with coefficients, notably the cluster structure on the Grassmannian and its positroid strata. In this lecture series, I will survey these ideas.
