## Information 

- **Venue**: Zoom  
- **Date**: March 1-4, 2022


### Aim

Preprojective algebras are algebras determined by a quiver, which are not only important in their representation theory but are also fundamental objects used in the Lusztig and Nakajima quiver varieties, and they have a deep connection between representation theory of Lie algebras and quantum groups.

The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers focusing on
the representation theory of preprojective algebras and Calabi-Yau algebras and the connection between related combinatorics, geometry and integrable systems.
